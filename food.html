                Ta’meya and ful mudammas, which are essentially fava beans and
                falafel are the original Egyptian fast-foods. They’re a staple of
                the Egyptian diet, mainly because they’re filling and use
                ingredients that are easily accessible in the country. The ful is
                made of fava beans that are cooked for hours in a pot called a
                qedra. The ta-meya, which is an Egyptian falafel, is made out of
                crushed fava beans that is later made into a paste, then fried.
                Nowadays you can find falafels all over the Middle East however,
                Egypt is the actual origin of those delightful fried treats. A
                perfect dish for all you vegos!
